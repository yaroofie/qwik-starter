# Project Structure

## Atomic Design System

### Atoms

These atoms include basic HTML elements like form labels, inputs, buttons, and others that can’t be broken down any further without ceasing to be functional

### Molecules

molecules are relatively simple groups of UI elements functioning together as a unit. For example, a form label, search input, and button can join together to create a search form molecule.

### Organisms

Organisms are relatively complex UI components composed of groups of molecules and/or atoms and/or other organisms. These organisms form distinct sections of an interface.
Organisms can consist of similar or different molecule types. A header organism might consist of dissimilar elements such as a logo image, primary navigation list, and search form. We see these types of organisms on almost every website we visit.

### Templates (Layouts)

Templates are page-level objects that place components into a layout and articulate the design’s underlying content structure.

### Pages (Routes)

Pages are specific instances of templates that show what a UI looks like with real representative content in place.
